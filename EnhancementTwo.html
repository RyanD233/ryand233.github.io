        <h2>Narrative</h2>
        <p>The contacts project was made in CS 320 in 2024. It simulates 
            how a phone would store and access contact data. It also allows users to 
            create and update their own contacts. I learned a lot about making test 
            cases and verifying input while originally creating this project.
        </p>
        <p>I selected this artifact to enhance because of the inefficient use of an 
            array list. All the methods had a for loop that would run through the 
            entire contact array in the worst-case scenario. I also noticed that a 
            hash map would fit perfectly as an enhancement, because each contact already 
            as a unique id for the map keys. I changed the contactList array list to a 
            dictionary and fixed every piece of code that needed to access it. This 
            also ended up simplifying the code base as most methods got reduced to one 
            line of code. Finally, I made the contact class more readable by changing the 
            magic numbers in verification to final fields and I added verification to 
            make sure the phone number is an integer. The enhancement showcased my 
            knowledge in the efficiency of hash maps and my ability to replace one data 
            structure with another effectively. My solution is aligned with 
            course outcome four, because I examined and implemented tools to find a more 
            efficient computing solution.
        </p>
        <p>
             I learned more about implementing hash maps with java while enhancing 
             this artifact. I was surprised by how many lines of code were cut just 
             by changing from an array list to a hash map. The only challenge I faced 
             while enhancing this artifact was updating the addContact method. I had to 
             make sure that the hash mapâ€™s containsKey method would not break if the 
             map is empty. Since it does not, I only needed to check if the id was 
             already in the contact list.
