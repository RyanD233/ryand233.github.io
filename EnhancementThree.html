        <h2>Narrative</h2>
        <p>
            The Rescue Animal project and Driver class was made in IT 145 in 2023. 
            It allows users to store information about animals used in rescue situations, 
            reserve them, and view the stored names. It used the Scanner object and terminal 
            to take input and provide output. 
        </p>

            For the database enhancement I decided to turn the array lists of dogs and 
            monkeys into collections in a MongoDB database. I chose this enhancement to 
            demonstrate my ability to recognize when persistent data is needed and implement 
            a secure database. I used localhost to connect to the database to make outside 
            connections less vulnerable. The downside of this is that it is hard to have 
            more than one computer interact with the database. The enhancement also 
            demonstrated my ability to seamlessly interact with the database using a graphical 
            user interface. This enhancement met the fourth and fifth course outcomes as 
            it uses tools like MongoDB and well-founded techniques in databases while keeping 
            the interactions secure.
        </p>
        <p>
             I learned more about connecting to and interacting with databases using 
             java. My first problem was setting up the maven dependencies for MongoDB. I 
             had to look up the correct maven commands and it took me a while to figure out 
             how to reload the dependencies so the code could see them. I then used MongoDB 
             Compass to set up and verify my connection and interactions with the database. 
             My final issue was making sure that my filters and updates to the database were 
             accessing the correct documents and fields. I used a combination of trying 
             different inputs to the software and checking MongoDB Compass to make sure I was 
             getting the correct data.
