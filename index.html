        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Ryan Davis and I am a computer science student at Southern New 
            Hampshire University. I am currently in my last semester before graduating with 
            my bachelor's degree. My goal is to become a video game developer and eventually 
            work on my own games. I have been programming for about 8 years and have experience 
            with Java, C#, GDScript, C++, Python, HTML/CSS, TypeScript, and JavaScript. I have 
            worked on projects ranging from simple console applications to full stack web 
            applications. I also have experience with game engines like Unity and Godot.
        </p>
        <h2>Portfolio Self-Assessment</h2>
        <p>
            I have learned important computer science concepts and how to implement them 
            into my work by completing coursework throughout my degree. I learned how to 
            write technical write ups for systems that include agile methodologies and 
            diagrams. I also learned how to make non-technical write ups that would be 
            used to communicate system designs to project leaders and stakeholders. In my 
            systems architecture class, I wrote a paper comparing and giving recommendations 
            on what type of hardware should be used for a cloud thermostat. Using version 
            control, discussions with other classmates, and practicing common coding practices, 
            I learned more about collaborating in a team environment. In my enhancement project 
            I showcase my knowledge of the power of hash maps and where they should be used. 
            I also showcase my ability to make a user interface that is easy to use and 
            validates user input. Finally, the database enhancement demonstrates my ability 
            to implement secure coding practices and recognize when persistent data is needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user interface enhancement converted a program that was completely interacted 
            with in the terminal to a user interface that guides the user through it 
            intuitively. The hash map enhancement transformed an array list of contact 
            information into a hash map that is more efficient when looking up the contact 
            information. The database enhancement builds upon the user interface enhancement 
            by storing user input in a database for accessing later. Enhancing user experience 
            and application efficiency works towards my goal of becoming a video game developer.
